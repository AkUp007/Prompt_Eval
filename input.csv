"Broad goal: designing a one-week community health campaign.
Required elements to add complexity: Multi-step reasoning, edge-case handling","We need to run a one-week community health campaign to boost healthy eating and exercise.
1. Identify main groups (kids, adults, seniors) and what stops them from healthy habits.
2. Write a slogan for each group and suggest two types of events (like “free yoga” or “nutrition workshop”).
3. Plan events Monday through Friday—describe location and time. If it rains, say what to do.
4. List two local organizations to partner with and what they could contribute.
5. Explain how we’ll measure success (attendance or surveys).
Return everything in one document with headings for each step. "
"Broad goal: designing a one-week community health campaign.
Required elements to add complexity: Multi-step reasoning, edge-case handling","You are a public health coordinator for a town of 50,000. Design a one?week nutrition and fitness campaign as follows:
1. Audience Segments:
   • Identify three groups (e.g., children ?12, adults 18–50, seniors >65) and two barriers each faces.
2. Messages:
   • For each group, write one slogan and a tagline.
   • Use age?appropriate, culturally sensitive language.
3. Event Schedule:
   • Plan five events (e.g., “Day 1: School assembly + veggie tasting”).
   • If rain >50% chance, move outdoor events indoors (e.g., community center).
4. Partnerships:
   • List three local partners and what they’ll provide (e.g., “YMCA: instructor for fitness class”).
   • If any partner cancels, use a volunteer or pre?recorded video.
5. Evaluation:
   • Choose two metrics (e.g., attendance, pre/post survey on servings).
   • Describe one qualitative feedback method.
   • If under 30 surveys per group, extend data collection by two days at a grocery stand.
Return a single document with sections: “Audience Segments,” “Messages,” “Event Schedule,” “Partnerships,” and “Evaluation.” Include numbered subsections matching these steps."
